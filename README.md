An uncaught exception handler library like Square's [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary).

## Getting started

**NOTE: There is a big bug before VERSION 0.9.5, QAQ thank goodness, it has been fixed in version 0.9.5, please update to 0.9.5+**

In your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
  debugCompile 'me.drakeet.library:crashwoodpecker:0.9.81'
  releaseCompile 'me.drakeet.library:crashwoodpecker-do-nothing:0.9.7'
}
```

In your `Application` class:

```java
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {

  @Override public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    CrashWoodpecker.init(this);
    // CrashWoodpecker.init(this, true /* forceHandleByOrigin */);
  }
}
```

And in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
    android:name=".ExampleApplication" // <-- 
    ...>
    ...
</application>
```

**That is all!** CrashWoodpecker will automatically show an Activity when your app crash with uncaught exceptions including new thread exceptions in your debug build.
